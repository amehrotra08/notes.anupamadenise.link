# Notes
## Spaced Repetition: 
Space your repetition of particular subjects over a period of time. In contrast to "Cramming". Due to the [[ðŸ§© Forgetting Curve]], this is an effective way to remember / study / engage the brain and ensure longer memory.

Key is letting brain forget somethings, and every time you re-learn, it "codes" in the brain a bit better and it's harder to forget.
