Welcome to my attempt at a Digial Garden. Like quite a few members of the [[Deep Productivity]] community, I learned a lot during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. One of them was about [[🧩Zettlekasten Method]]. I started working on building my [[Second Brain]] in [[🧩Notion]] and I found that software so clunky, fairly confusing and unclear to use. I'd just left AirTable after trying their free premium trial for a content calendar, and Notion less good at what AirTable did. In fact, I'd describe Notion as the true jack-of-all trades - poor for most things and probably mediocre at the rest. But it tried to do too many things and I didn't particularly like any of them. 🤷🏾‍♀️. 

I digress. Next!

I did plenty of research on [[🧩Roam Research]] and at the time, my primary driver was a PC, not a mac. In addition, I had lots of concerns about the longevity of the software, the price, and the ecosystem it locked me into. Next!

Enter [[🧩Obsidian]], a free, open-source platform. Available for all systems, macOS or Windows, and just cool enough (I'm a sucker for dark mode) for me to bite into. 

It's been about 6 months, and I have stuck with Obsidian. I've changed to the Apple ecosystem and have had an absolute blast. 

I've recently recommitted to posting regularly on my blog - which covers a range of topics I'm passionate about. It's overwhelming to me, and I assume the average human who stumbles across it. Whelp, after obsessively lurking in deep productivity spaces, I discovered the ideas propogated by Ali Abdaal regarding showing ones' work, getting started, and focusing on quantity over quality. Nike's "Just Do It" is raging in my brain. 

Cue my (new found?) love of programming... 

More to come.
